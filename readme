This is an easy way to make a custom alert in Swift

To setup:
  1. Create a Swift viewcontroller in storyboard with a label and a button on the view
  2. Set the beackground color to clear color on the viewcontroller
  3. Add the Swift file to the viewcontroller and connect IBOutlets and IBAction
  4. Add "alertText" under "root" in "info.plist"
  5. Present the viewcontroller using the other Swift file
